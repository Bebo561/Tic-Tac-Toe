# Technologies Used

React, bootstrap, Typescript

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to give myself more practice with React, as well as familiarize myself with the typescript language. Typescript is a language that many web developers enjoy and give praise to, so I felt that adding typescript to my skillset would be an obvious decision. Of course, the tic tac toe project is a very basic project that all web developers have made at one point or another, so I also decided that I wanted to make this the most functionally complete and fair tic tac toe game where users can choose to play against a friend or a computer opponent. I also intended to develop my CSS skills by adding a custom line through the winning combonation to reflect how the game is player in real life.
